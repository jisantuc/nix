   Maintains a mapping from hashes to filenames within the NixValues

   reconstructed unambiguously.  The reason is that names in this
   directory are not printed hashes but also might carry some
   descriptive element (e.g., "aterm-2.0-ae749a...").  Without this
   mapping, looking up a value would take O(n) time because we would
   need to read the entire directory. */
