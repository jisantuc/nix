Overview
========

Nix is a package manager, deployment system, and component glue
mechanism.


Prerequisites
=============

* Berkeley DB 4.0.14
* CWI ATerm 2.0


Installation
============

* When building from the Subversion repository, first do:

    autoreconf -i

* To build, do:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

  Note that this will install to /nix, which is the default prefix.
  You can specify another prefix, but this is not recommended if you
  want to use prebuilt packages from other sources.
