# General operation:
#
# Try to find a free machine of type $neededSystem.  We do this as
# follows:
# - We acquire an exclusive lock on $currentLoad/main-lock.
# - For each machine $machine of type $neededSystem and for each $slot
#   less than the maximum load for that machine, we try to get an
#   exclusive lock on $currentLoad/$machine-$slot (without blocking).
#   If we get such a lock, we send "accept" to the caller.  Otherwise,
#   we send "postpone" and exit. 
# - We release the exclusive lock on $currentLoad/main-lock.
# - We perform the build on $neededSystem.
# - We release the exclusive lock on $currentLoad/$machine-$slot.
#
# The nice thing about this scheme is that if we die prematurely, the
# locks are released automatically.
