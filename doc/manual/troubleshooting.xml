    <para>
      Every time a Nix database transaction takes place, Nix writes a record of
      this transaction to a <emphasis>log</emphasis> in its database directory
      to ensure that the operation can be replayed in case of a application or
      system crash.  However, without manual intervention, the log grows
      indefinitely.  Hence, unused log files should be deleted periodically.
      This can be accomplished using the following command:

    <screen>
      $ rm `db_archive -a -h <replaceable>prefix</replaceable>/var/nix/db`</screen>
