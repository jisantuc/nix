    <para>
      The command <command>nix-pull</command> obtains a list of
      pre-built store paths from the URL
      <replaceable>url</replaceable>, and for each of these store
      paths, registers a substitute derivation that downloads and
      unpacks it into the Nix store.  This is used to speed up
      installations: if you attempt to install something that has
      already been built and stored into the network cache, Nix can
      transparently re-use the pre-built store paths.
    </para>

    <para>
      The file at <replaceable>url</replaceable> must be compatible
      with the files created by <replaceable>nix-push</replaceable>.
