      <para>
	Unify the concepts of successors and substitutes into a general notion
	of <emphasis>equivalent expressions</emphasis>.  Expressions are
	equivalent if they have the same target paths with the same
	identifiers.  However, even though they are functionally equivalent,
	they may differ stronly with respect to their <emphasis>performance
	  characteristics</emphasis>.  For example, realising a slice is more
	efficient that realising the derivation from which that slice was
	produced.  On the other hand, distributing sources may be more
	efficient (storage- or bandwidth-wise) than distributing binaries.  So
	we need to be able to attach weigths or priorities or performance
	annotations to expressions; Nix can then choose the most efficient
	expression dependent on the context.
