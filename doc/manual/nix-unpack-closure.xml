<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para>The command <command>nix-unpack-closure</command> unpacks the
closure of a set of store paths created by
<command>nix-pack-closure</command> into the local Nix store.  The
closure is a single file read from standard input.  See the
description of <command>nix-pack-closure</command> for details and
examples.</para>

<para>The top-level paths in the closure (i.e., the paths passed to
the original <command>nix-pack-closure</command> call that created the
closure) are printed on standard output.  These paths can be passed,
for instance, to <literal>nix-env -i</literal> to install them into a
user environment on the target machine.</para>
